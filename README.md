# ALX SQL Data Science Exercises

Welcome to my SQL exercise repository for the ALX Data Science Program! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various SQL concepts and techniques learned throughout the program.

## üìö Repository Overview

This repository contains hands-on SQL exercises and tutorials covering fundamental to advanced SQL concepts. All exercises are implemented using Jupyter notebooks with SQL magic commands, allowing for an interactive learning experience.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Through these exercises, I have learned to:
- Write basic SQL queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `LIMIT` statements
- Perform data filtering and analysis using logical and comparison operators
- Use SQL functions for string manipulation, numeric calculations, and date/time operations
- Apply aggregation functions and window functions for advanced data analysis
- Join multiple tables and work with relational databases
- Create summary statistics and reports
- Clean and transform data using SQL

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Database**: SQLite (Chinook sample database)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Language**: SQL with Python integration
- **Tools**: SQL magic commands (`%%sql`, `%sql`)

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

Most exercises use the Chinook database, which represents a digital media store with the following main tables:
- `customers` - Customer information
- `employees` - Employee data
- `invoices` - Sales transactions
- `invoice_items` - Individual items in transactions
- `tracks` - Music tracks
- `albums` - Music albums
- `artists` - Music artists
- `genres` - Music genres
- `media_types` - File formats
- `playlists` - Music playlists

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  pip install ipython-sql
  pip install sqlalchemy
  ```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rugwiroparfait/ALX_SQL.git
   cd ALX_SQL
   ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open any notebook file (`.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially

4. Load the SQL extension in each notebook:
   ```python
   %load_ext sql
   %sql sqlite:///chinook.db
   ```
